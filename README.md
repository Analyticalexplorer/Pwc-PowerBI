# Pwc-PowerBI

In pursuit of enhancing my data analysis and visualization skills, I undertook a comprehensive Power BI case study in collaboration with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). This engaging project not only allowed me to delve into the world of business intelligence but also equipped me with hands-on experience in transforming raw data into actionable insights.

The case study involved working with a real-world dataset, employing advanced data modeling techniques, and creating interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI. The objective was to extract meaningful insights from complex data and present them in a visually informative manner for effective decision-making.

During the case study, I meticulously cleaned, transformed, and shaped the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I designed interactive visuals that highlighted key performance indicators (KPIs), trends, and patterns relevant to the business context. The visuals included dynamic charts, drill-through reports, and slicers, allowing stakeholders to explore the data from various angles.
